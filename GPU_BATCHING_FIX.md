# GPU Batching Optimization - Fixed Approach

## Summary of Changes

The previous implementation was **completely wrong** for GPU utilization. Here's what was fixed:

### ❌ Previous (Wrong) Approach
- Set `num_workers=24` thinking more workers = more GPU usage
- Result: **99.97% CPU usage, only 1.45% GPU usage**
- Problem: Workers in faster-whisper handle CPU preprocessing, not GPU inference
- This created a CPU bottleneck while the GPU sat idle

### ✅ New (Correct) Approach
- Use `BatchedInferencePipeline` for true GPU batching
- Calculate optimal `batch_size` based on GPU memory
- Reasonable worker count (4-8) to avoid CPU bottleneck
- Focus on GPU compute efficiency rather than worker count

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Fixed `maximize_gpu_utilization()`
```python
# OLD: Set aggressive worker counts (wrong)
num_workers = 24  # This was maxing out CPU!

# NEW: Calculate optimal batch size and reasonable workers
if gpu_memory >= 8:
    optimal_batch_size = 8
    num_workers = 6  # Reasonable for preprocessing
```

### 2. Updated `setup_model()` to use BatchedInferencePipeline
```python
# NEW: Use batching for real GPU utilization
base_model = WhisperModel(model_size, device="cuda", compute_type="float16")
batched_model = BatchedInferencePipeline(
    model=base_model,
    chunk_length=30,
    stride_length_s=5,
    use_bettertransformer=True,
)
```

### 3. Updated `transcribe_audio()` to support batch processing
```python
# NEW: Pass batch_size to BatchedInferencePipeline
transcription_params['batch_size'] = batch_size
segments_generator, info = model.transcribe(audio_file, **transcription_params)
```

## Expected Results

### GPU Utilization
- **Before**: 1.45% GPU, 99.97% CPU (CPU-bound)
- **After**: Should see 60-90% GPU utilization (GPU-bound)

### Performance
- **Batch processing** should significantly increase throughput
- **GPU memory** will be better utilized
- **CPU usage** should be reasonable (not maxed out)

## How to Verify

1. **Run the transcription** with the new code
2. **Monitor GPU usage** in Task Manager or nvidia-smi
3. **Expected**: High GPU utilization, reasonable CPU usage
4. **Speed**: Should be faster due to proper GPU batching

## Technical Details

### BatchedInferencePipeline vs WhisperModel
- `WhisperModel`: Sequential processing, limited GPU utilization
- `BatchedInferencePipeline`: Batches multiple audio chunks for parallel GPU processing

### Optimal Batch Sizes
- **8GB GPU**: batch_size=8
- **16GB+ GPU**: batch_size=16
- **Smaller models**: Can use larger batch sizes

### Memory Management
- BatchedInferencePipeline automatically manages GPU memory
- Avoids OOM errors while maximizing utilization
- Better than manual worker management

## Next Steps

1. Test with actual audio file
2. Monitor GPU utilization (should be much higher)
3. Compare transcription speed with old approach
4. Fine-tune batch sizes if needed

This fix addresses the fundamental misunderstanding about how faster-whisper uses workers vs. GPU batching.
