# Speaker Assignment Content Fix Summary

## Issues Identified
The speaker mapping algorithm was working correctly, but there were two significant issues causing problems:

### Issue 1: Extra Content Injection
The speaker assignment prompt was instructing the AI to add:
- **Header**: Disclaimer about AI-generated content
- **Footer**: WikiMedia category tags
- **Formatting**: Wrapper sections like "== Transcript =="

This caused:
- **Content inflation**: 496% word retention instead of ~100%
- **Misleading statistics**: Made it appear content was being preserved when actually being expanded
- **Unwanted output**: Users getting disclaimers and wiki formatting they didn't request

### Issue 2: Misleading Retention Metrics
Because of the extra content, the system reported:
- Word retention: 496.7% (should be ~100%)
- Character retention: 471.2% (should be ~100%)
- This made it impossible to detect actual content loss issues

## Fix Applied

### Updated Speaker Assignment Prompt
**Before:**
```
Header (before transcript):
== Disclaimer ==
This is the full transcript generated using with AI tools and some human oversight...

== Transcript <<episode number>> ==

Footer (after transcript):
[[Category:WHYcast]] [[Category:transcription]] [[Episode number::<episode number>| ]]
```

**After:**
```
## OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return ONLY the processed transcript with speaker labels replaced. Do not add any headers, footers, disclaimers, or additional content. The output should be the same content as input with only the speaker tags changed.
```

## Expected Results

### Clean Output Format
**Before Fix:**
```
== Disclaimer ==
This is the full transcript generated using with AI tools...
== Transcript <<episode number>> ==
Host: Welcome back to the show everyone.
Guest: Thanks for having me on.
[[Category:WHYcast]] [[Category:transcription]]...
```

**After Fix:**
```
Host: Welcome back to the show everyone.
Guest: Thanks for having me on.
Speaker: I think this is fascinating.
```

### Accurate Retention Metrics
- Word retention: ~100% (±5% for speaker label changes)
- Character retention: ~95-105% (slight variation due to label length differences)
- Clean, focused output without unwanted additions

## Algorithm Confirmation
The core speaker identification algorithm was working correctly:
- ✅ **Analysis phase**: o4 model correctly identifies speakers and roles
- ✅ **Mapping phase**: Creates appropriate `[SPEAKER_XX] → Name` mappings  
- ✅ **Application phase**: Correctly replaces tags with clean `Name:` format
- ✅ **Bracket handling**: Properly removes brackets from final output

The issue was purely in the output formatting, not the core speaker identification logic.

## Testing
Created `test_clean_assignment.py` to verify:
- No unwanted headers/footers in output
- Appropriate word retention rates
- Clean speaker label replacement
- Content preservation without inflation
