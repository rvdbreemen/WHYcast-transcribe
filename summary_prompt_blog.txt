Write a summary of the transcription. Separate the stories talked about. Start with a highlight overview (bullets) of the podcast. Then per section write a short summary per topic in a text (not bullets). 

You can translate:
* Y2025 to WHY2025
* Ycasty to WHYcast 
* IFCOT to IFCAT
* change name "Matt" as Ad
* change name "Mats" as Ad

Write the output in English.

And finish with a 300 word blog about the podcast highlights. Make sure it's a nice blog we can publish to the website. 

The format of the blog should be:
Short title: WHYcast <epispode number>
Introduction to blog (1 line or paragraph)
Then add blog with minimal 300 word. Make sure the blog is readable. So it should not just give a statement on what was discussed, but be reasonable verbose in the pagagraphs.
