### **Introduction to WHYcast and Hosts**
Nancy, Chantal, and Ad introduce **WHYcast**, the only podcast about a hacker camp. The camp, **WHY2025**, is a volunteer-driven event happening in the Netherlands from August 8-12, 2025. The hosts share their involvement: Nancy is co-chair of **IFCAT**, the legal entity overseeing Dutch hacker camps; Chantal leads Team Info and co-leads Team Content; and Ad supports Team Info and helps run the podcast.

### **What is WHY2025?**
WHY2025 is the 10th edition of a major hacker camp in the Netherlands, organized entirely by volunteers. The camp consists of **42 teams**, a deliberate reference to the famous number from *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy*. Participants camp outdoors, staying in tents while attending talks, workshops, and hands-on activities. The camp caters to hackers, makers, and technology enthusiasts, featuring everything from **Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions** to bizarre engineering projects—like a drone built into an ostrich.

### **The Camp Experience**
Unlike formal conferences, WHY2025 fosters an informal, creative atmosphere where attendees share knowledge, experiment, and have fun. The event includes:
- **Villages**, where groups can set up spaces based on interests, including open-source software, security, or government-related topics.
- **Interactive art**, such as LED installations and maker showcases.
- **Family-friendly zones**, ensuring an inclusive environment for participants of all ages.
- **High-speed internet**, with past events offering a 200 Gbps uplink and 10 Gbps connections per tent.
- **Hands-on learning opportunities**, including food hacking, jewelry making, and hardware tinkering.

### **Why a Podcast?**
The team started WHYcast because there was no dedicated podcast for Dutch hacker camps. While there are existing **mailing lists, wikis, and websites**, the podcast offers a **weekly 30-minute update** every Friday. Future episodes will feature **interviews with team leads**, updates on camp organization, and discussions on emerging trends in technology and hacking.

### **The Volunteer System**
WHY2025 thrives on **volunteer participation**. Visitors can contribute in various ways:
- **Pre-event teams** handle infrastructure, organization, and content planning.
- **On-site volunteers (called Angels)** assist with logistics, speaker introductions, video recording, and maintaining the camp.
- **Specialized teams**, such as **Team Nuts**, manage power, internet, and utilities, while **Cohesion (Team Duct Tape)** ensures a safe and welcoming environment.
- **Visitors can help spontaneously**, doing small tasks for an hour or two to support the community.

### **Looking Ahead**
The podcast will cover various topics, including:
- **Updates on the camp’s progress**
- **Open calls for volunteers**
- **Features on other hacker camps worldwide**
- **A history series on past Dutch hacker camps**

The hosts also invite listeners to contribute by creating jingles for segment transitions, as long as they come with the proper licensing.
