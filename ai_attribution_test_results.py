SPEAKER_UNKNOWN ATTRIBUTION ANALYSIS
===================================

SEGMENT: [SPEAKER_UNKNOWN] We have a vacancy of the week and we have listener questions. It sounds like a format.
POSITION: Line 5, between [SPEAKER_04] and [SPEAKER_01]

CONTEXT ANALYSIS:
- Preceding Context: Ad (SPEAKER_04) was listing show segments: "We have the news. We have an interview. We have a where to hack."
- Topic Continuity: This segment continues the exact same list structure with "We have a vacancy..."
- Conversational Role: Continuation of list/enumeration, followed by meta-commentary

ATTRIBUTION REASONING:
- Most Likely Speaker: [SPEAKER_04] (Ad)
- Confidence Level: High
- Supporting Evidence:
  1. Identical sentence structure "We have..." continuing Ad's established pattern
  2. Meta-commentary "It sounds like a format" matches speaker who was creating the list
  3. Natural flow: Ad lists elements â†’ Comments on his own structure

FLOW ANALYSIS:
- Response Pattern: Self-continuation and self-reflection
- Topic Ownership: Ad initiated and owns the show structure discussion
- Speech Characteristics: Meta-conversational awareness typical of host

ALTERNATIVE CONSIDERATIONS:
- Second Most Likely: [SPEAKER_01] (Nancy) responding to Ad's list
- Reasons for Uncertainty: Could be Nancy observing Ad's format, but structure suggests continuation

================================================================================

SEGMENT: [SPEAKER_UNKNOWN] an angel, right? Yes.
POSITION: Line 17, between [SPEAKER_01] and [SPEAKER_01]

CONTEXT ANALYSIS:
- Preceding Context: Nancy (SPEAKER_01) said "And you also signed up as"
- Topic Continuity: Completes Nancy's sentence and provides confirmation
- Conversational Role: Sentence completion + affirmative response

ATTRIBUTION REASONING:
- Most Likely Speaker: [SPEAKER_04] (Ad)
- Confidence Level: High
- Supporting Evidence:
  1. Nancy's sentence "And you also signed up as" is directed at Ad
  2. "an angel, right? Yes." completes her question and provides Ad's answer
  3. Following context shows Nancy continuing to talk about Ad's role

FLOW ANALYSIS:
- Response Pattern: Direct response to question about self
- Topic Ownership: Nancy asking about Ad's participation
- Speech Characteristics: Confirming personal information

ALTERNATIVE CONSIDERATIONS:
- Second Most Likely: [SPEAKER_01] (Nancy) completing her own thought
- Reasons for Uncertainty: Could be Nancy finishing her sentence, but "Yes" response indicates Ad

================================================================================

SEGMENT: [SPEAKER_UNKNOWN] One
POSITION: Line 23, between [SPEAKER_04] and [SPEAKER_04]

CONTEXT ANALYSIS:
- Preceding Context: Ad (SPEAKER_04) said "Yes."
- Topic Continuity: Sentence fragment that connects to following explanation
- Conversational Role: Numerical enumeration beginning

ATTRIBUTION REASONING:
- Most Likely Speaker: [SPEAKER_04] (Ad)
- Confidence Level: High
- Supporting Evidence:
  1. Clear sentence fragment: "Yes. [One] of my tasks will be to..."
  2. Same speaker before and after the unknown segment
  3. Natural speech pattern with pause/fragment in middle of explanation

FLOW ANALYSIS:
- Response Pattern: Self-continuation across speech segments
- Topic Ownership: Ad explaining his own role and responsibilities
- Speech Characteristics: Natural speech fragmentation in single thought

ALTERNATIVE CONSIDERATIONS:
- Second Most Likely: None reasonable
- Reasons for Uncertainty: Almost certain this is Ad continuing his own sentence

================================================================================

ATTRIBUTION SUMMARY
==================

HIGH CONFIDENCE ATTRIBUTIONS:
[SPEAKER_UNKNOWN] Line 5 â†’ [SPEAKER_04] (Ad) - 95% confidence
[SPEAKER_UNKNOWN] Line 17 â†’ [SPEAKER_04] (Ad) - 90% confidence  
[SPEAKER_UNKNOWN] Line 23 â†’ [SPEAKER_04] (Ad) - 98% confidence

MEDIUM CONFIDENCE ATTRIBUTIONS:
None in this sample

LOW CONFIDENCE / KEEP AS UNKNOWN:
None in this sample

IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Apply all three high confidence attributions automatically
- Pattern: Most SPEAKER_UNKNOWN segments are speech fragments from diarization errors
- Context flow analysis is highly effective for attribution
- Same speaker before/after UNKNOWN is strong indicator (Lines 17 & 23)
