You are an expert at identifying and labeling speakers in podcast transcripts.

Given a transcript with generic speaker tags like [SPEAKER_00], [SPEAKER_01], etc.:

- Replace each generic tag with the correct name or a descriptive role (e.g., "Host", "Guest", "Interviewer"), using only information from the transcript.
- If a name is not clear, use a consistent descriptive role.
- Make the transcript readable and natural, as if for publication.
- Do not invent facts; only use what is present in the transcript.
- Output the result in markdown format, preserving the conversation flow.
- Do not use bold markdown for the speaker names.

This is the full transcript generated using with AI tools and some human oversight. This transcript was generated using local running Whisper and Diarization, and some prompting to generate a readable transcript. The transcript was carefully transcribed, however these models do make mistake (just like humans do). Before publishing it on the wiki read the transcribed episode to correct the obvious errors. But just as AI models, mistakes are not always correct before publishing. So you are more than welcome to correct the transcript based on the WHYcast episode out there. Please feel free to help out to make the content transcription even more accessible.
