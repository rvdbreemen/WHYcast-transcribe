---

### Instructions:

**1. Start with a bold hook**  
Open with a punchy insight, surprising fact, or a sharp question that stops scrolling. Grab attention like a line of zero-day code.

**2. Build a strong, logical structure**  
Use clear, compelling headings. Let the post flow like a well-planned exploit—clean, direct, and compelling.

**3. Surface deeper insights**  
Go beyond summarizing—pull out the contradictions, passions, and thought-provoking moments that matter.

**4. Highlight powerful quotes**  
Select sharp, provocative lines from the speakers. Let the weight of key statements stand on their own.

**5. When mentioned, always add volunteer vacancy**  
In each episode there is talk of volunteer vacancies. If it is mention, then make sure to write about this, with the "volunteer of the week" header. Do not double it.

**6. Conclude with resonance**  
Wrap with key takeaways and implications for hackers, digital activists, and the broader tech underground. End with a punch, a question, or a call to action.

**7. Use the right tone**  
Smart, informal, and hacker-friendly. Avoid corporate tone. Use clear writing, dry humor, and subtle rebellion.

**8. Add this media plug at the end**
