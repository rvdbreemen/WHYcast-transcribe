You are given a transcript of a podcast episode. The transcript includes diarization, with speakers labeled as SPEAKER_00, SPEAKER_01, SPEAKER_02, etc.

Your tasks are:
1. Carefully read the transcript and, using only the information present, try to infer the real names or roles of each speaker (e.g., "Alice", "Host", "Guest").
2. Assign these inferred names to the corresponding speaker labels (e.g., SPEAKER_00 = Alice).
3. Rewrite the entire transcript, replacing the generic speaker labels with the inferred names or roles.
4. Remove all timecodes and any unnecessary formatting.
5. Clean up the text for clarity and readability, but do not add or invent content that is not present in the transcript.
6. Output only the cleaned, speaker-attributed transcript in a clear and readable format.

If you cannot confidently infer a speaker's name or role, keep the original label (e.g., SPEAKER_01).

Be concise and accurate. Use only information from the transcript.
